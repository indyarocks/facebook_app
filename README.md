facebook_app
============

It's a basic app to get facebook user details using fb_access token and store it in a database.

I'm using FB Graph API to pull the details of a user based on FB access token. The access token 
can be found by following FB API.

Graph API Explorer:

Currently, the page is a basic skeleton, deployed on heroku server.
